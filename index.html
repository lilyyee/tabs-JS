                I spent years reviewing thousands of medical cases as a
                registered nurse for insurance companies. I was at the top of my
                game earning a six-figure salary working from home. However, I
                was stressed out and unhappy.
              </p>

                In 2019, I decided to take a career break for a self-care
                sabbatical. I started a wellness coaching business and by
                accident, I quickly became so fascinated with web development
                after I built my first website. After that, I decided to leave
                my registered nursing career behind.

                I'm a web developer who wants to build powerful sites and
                applications that are simple, easy to understand, and
                functional. I aim to use my developer skills to promote
                wellness, education, and hopefully, make life simpler.
